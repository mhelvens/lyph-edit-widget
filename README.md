# lyph-edit-widget

A lyph editor for ApiNATOMY using `boxer`.

This library is supposed to expose a widget for drawing
artefacts, but at the moment it is a full app.
The file that comprises the widget is more or less
`NgBoxer.js`, but it hasn't been packaged as such,
because this code had to be written in somewhat of
a rush.
